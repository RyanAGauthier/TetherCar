> # Requirements:
> In order to use the code I've written, you must include the necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE. Assuming you've already added the 
> board itself after following the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-adalogger/setup), this is done by 
> clicking "Tools" OR "Sketch"->"Include Libraries" then "Manage Libraries". You'll need to atleast include the MPRLS library and the 
> MAX31855 library, so search for those. I think it will ask if you want to install their additional dependencies, so answer "yes". The 
> other three libraries that appear at the top of the "M0Logger" file should be included with the IDE by default.
